# eclassTeacherAssist-hackX
this is a very simple but useful project , its purpose is to help the teacher by maintaining discipline, so that the teacher could focus on teaching rather than maintaining the decorum of the class
my program is using open-cv to detect any kind of possible motion, but here I have made some changes so that it serves the required purpose
Actually we are trying to develop a piece of code that could be used the Educational institutes to integrate this code in their E-classes system and it will notify the the teaching staff as the student trys to move away from his system during classes
